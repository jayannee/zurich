# zurich
Working on visualization with Prasenjit Saha

To work on this project you will need to do the following.

1. Create yourself an account on github (free).

2. Set ssh keys so you can communicate securely with the server.
   See https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

   This needs to be done only once per account per machine.

3. Clone the repository using 

   git clone git@github.com:jayannee/zurich
   
   Note: 'clone' == copy onto your computer


Files will go into the zurich/ directory.

You can update from the server at any time by typing

       git pull  
       
       Note: 'pull' is download

inside the zurich/ directory.

4. To edit collaboratively, tell me your username, so I can add you as
   a collaborator.

5. Configure git on your machine, adapting the following

       git config --global user.name "Alan M Turing"
       git config --global user.email amt@universal.machine

   This is not essential, but good practice.  It's fine to put your
   real name and email address here -- no spam results.

6. When you add a new file that you wish to be tracked:

       git add myfile

7. When you want to send your current version to the server: 
    e.g. upload a file to the github requires both these steps

       git commit -am "short message"
       git push origin master   
       
       Note: 'push' == upload

8. A useful command is

       git status
